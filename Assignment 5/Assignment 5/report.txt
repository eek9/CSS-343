Hash Table Report
June 12, 2020

The results from my program shows a printed output of the size, minimum+maximum collisions, 
and number of empty array elements in the hashtable.
I have first provided a visual representation of each numbered bucket index with the chain of 
keys that link to the same value of index when inserting. Each time after the first key is
inserted within the index, it will count up the amount of collisions in that bucket.
The second information provided represents the number of buckets that limit where the keys
will be added within the array, also known as the array size.
The third and fourth information is the maximum and minimum counts of collisions. This represents
a record of the maximum and minimum counts of collisions overall within the provided amount of
buckets. Whenever a bucket contains more than one key for that index, it is considered a collision.
This also means if we use a function to call by the index of an array and see what keys are contained in
it, you will end with more than one key if there are multiple collisions from that index.
Lastly, the final information is the number of elements with no data. This is counted by observing
each area of the array by index, to check if they do not contain any keys from that bucket. If it
is empty, it will count up the records for this information of empty buckets.
